Workshops in Web Dev 1 - HTTP-5114-0NA

This course will allow students to access additional support for content delivered in the other classes each semester. Every student in the class will engage in a process of self-assessment to help them identify areas where they would benefit from help, and then the student and teaching team will set up a process for providing support for any areas where the student would benefit from some in-the-moment support. Mentors, tutors and workshops will be available.
